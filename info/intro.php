                <h6 class="text-center">Question that has been asked the most: Do I need a degree to be a developer or do I need to go to College or University for it ?</h6><br>
                <p>A lot of people think of developers as of like some sort of super humans and a lot of people think that the only way to become a successful developer is by obtaining a degree from University. That is wrong. Obviously it does help if you have a academic background in Computing however a lot of succesful people that are developers are self-thaught. This topic is covered well in a blog post written by Alyssa Mazzina on Stackoverflow, which by the way will become your go-to for finding answers to some problems that you might come across, check it out !</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">What is programming?</h6><br>
                <p>Programming is writing computer code to create a program, to solve a problem. Programs are created to implement algorithms. Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart, and programming is the translation of these into a computer program.</p><br>
                <p>To tell a computer to do something, a program must be written to tell it exactly what to do and how to do it. If an algorithm has been designed, the computer program will follow this algorithm, step-by-step, which will tell the computer exactly what it should do.</p>
                <p>A more detailed explanation on this question 'What is programming?' can be found by watching the video below on YouTube from the channel called 'The Coding Train'. By the way, he does really great tutorials and coding challenges as well, you should definately check it out !</p><br>

                <br>
                <p>However it's a rather broad question to answer, perhaps you'd be interested in an article that was written by Freecodecamp which gives a much more detailed looked into what is programming. Link to this article can be found on the bottom of this paragraph, just click on it and a new browser tab will open up, give it a read and you'll have a much better understanding of the whole concept of programming and development.</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Think like a programmer</h6>
                <br>
                <p>Programming essentially is problem solving, It is not just writing hundreds or thousands of lines of code then hitting the run button and see how everything works together. When it comes to developing something there is a structure to follow and problems to solve, essentially the whole web page you'll be developing or the next app you'll be making can be considered as a problem and that problem needs to be solved. You would often see that developers have a completely different process of thinking and approaching things and without writing this too long there are two articles at the bottom of this paragraph that would be strongly to recommended to read through and understand what is and how to "Think like a programmer".</p>

                <p>Another great way to explain "How to think like a programmer" is to watch the video below posted by Forrest Knight on he's YouTube channel, the same as with the other channel mentioned above - you should definately check this channel out more, it has some great tips for people starting off and people that are experienced developers!</p>

                <br>
                <p>Surely there are plenty of other questions that come to your mind before diving in the world of programming but a strong suggestion would be to not to overwhelm yourself in the early stages of your new journey, the best way is to just start coding, once you'll learn how things work the answers will come themselves and the process of learning will give you enough curiosity to start looking for answers online, the amount of resources out there is really unimaginable and answers to most of question aren't that hard to find.</p>
