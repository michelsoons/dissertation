                <br>
                <h6 class="text-center">Text editors and Integrated development Environments(IDE)</h6><br>
                <p>when it comes to actually starting to learn how to program different things such as web pages, applications or even just basic softwares such as calculators the tools that you'll need aren't even that much. Depending on what exactly you want to focus on - either web development or software development, the environment that you'll be writing your code will vary. At the beginning of your journey in to web development all you'll really need is just a basic text editor and some of the most popular ones will be listed below this paragraph. If you decide that mobile development or software development is something that interests you more then depending on the programming language the environment changes, for software developemnt programmers use IDE's which is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Same as with text editors mentioned above, list of IDE's will be below this paragraph. </p>
                <p>Note that there are out there editors and IDE's that require a payment to obtain a licence to use it, at this stage of your journey using free of charge software will be more than enough.</p>
                <h6 class="text-center">Most popular free of charge Text Editors</h6><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a></li>

                <h6 class="text-center">Most popular free of charge IDE's</h6><br>
                <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ Idea by Jetbrains</a></li>

                        <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just click the links above and it will open a new tab in your browser so you can have a look at each of these editors and see which one would you prefer yourself!</p>
                <p>Bear in mind that some of the IDE's listed above are meant for developing applications on a specific system. For example Microsoft Visual Studio is mainly focused for Windows application development when Apple's Xcode is focused around development for applications that run on apple OS, iOS and watchOS. Once you start learning to program, most of the tutorials will have information on which text editor or IDE they are using and finding information about how to set everything up is relatively easy, some tutorials will hape specific sections on how to set up your environment.</p>
                <p>At this stage of your new journey there isn't anything more you'll need, as you will dive deeper with tutorials and knowledge then you will start to realise what other tools you might need. It really is that simple to start! Go ahead, take the quiz and start your journey in the development world!</p>
