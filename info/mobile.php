                <br>
                <h6 class="text-center">What is mobile development?</h6><br>
                <p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources. Hence, the mobile development process involves creating installable software bundles (code, binaries, assets, etc.) , implementing backend services such as data access with an API, and testing the application on target devices.</p>
                <h6 class="text-center">Applications and platforms</h6><br>
                <p>There are two dominant platforms in the modern smartphone market. One is the iOS platform from Apple Inc. The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line of iPhone smartphones. The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and other smart devices.</p>
                <p>Although there are some similarities between these two platforms when building applications, developing for iOS vs. developing for Android involves using different software development kits (SDKs) and different development toolchain. While Apple uses iOS exclusively for its own devices, Google makes Android available to other companies provided they meet specific requirements such as including certain Google applications on the devices they ship. Developers can build apps for hundreds of millions of devices by targeting both of these platforms.</p>
                <p>To become a developer for mobile applications you don't necesarilly need to learn mobile specific language, the support over the years towards mobile devices and their development has gone so much further that almost anyone who knows front-end and a little back-end development can make a mobile application by using the same tools and programming languages.</p>
                <p>A lot of mobile application nowadays are built using different JavaScript frameworks such as React native and Tabris.js more information regarding different frameworks for mobile application development can be found by reading the article below posted by Adolf Okrah on medium.com. Worth mentioning as well that medium.com is a great source to keep on top in terms of what is happening in development world, you can find loads of useful information and tutorials for your projects, definately check it out ! </p>
