                <h6 class="text-center">What is software development?</h6><br>
                <p>Software development is a process by which standalone or individual software is created using a specific programming language. It involves writing a series of interrelated programming code, which provides the functionality of the developed software. Software development may also be called application development and software design.</p>
                <p>Software development is an iterative logical process that aims to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a unique business or personal objective, goal or process. Software development is generally a planned initiative that consists of various steps or stages that result in the creation of operational software.</p>
                <p>Software development is primarily achieved through computer programming, which is carried out by a software programmer and includes processes such as initial research, data flow design, process flow design, flow charts, technical documentation, software testing, debugging and other software architecture techniques. This is known as the software development life cycle (SDLC).</p>
                <p>IBM has a great resource on describing what exactly software development is and what are different software development processes. The page can be accessed by clicking the link below.</p>
